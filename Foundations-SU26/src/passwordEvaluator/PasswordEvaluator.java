/*******
 * <p> Title: PasswordEvaluator Class. </p>
 *
 * <p> Description: A standalone password validator derived from the Directed Graph (Finite State
 * Machine) design used in the PasswordEvaluationTestbed-F26 application's passwordPopUpWindow.Model
 * class. This class contains only the validation logic - it has no dependency on any GUI widgets -
 * so it can be called directly from the account creation and account update pages of this
 * application, or from an automated test suite, without needing to instantiate a JavaFX Stage.
 *
 * In addition to the requirements demonstrated in the original testbed (at least one upper case
 * letter, one lower case letter, one numeric digit, one special character, and a minimum length
 * of 8 characters), this class adds a maximum length requirement. Without a maximum length, a
 * malicious or careless user could submit an extremely long string to see whether doing so
 * crashes the application - one of the standard first steps an attacker takes when probing a new
 * system for weaknesses. </p>

 * @version 1.00 2026-09-11 Adapted from passwordPopUpWindow.Model (Lynn Robert Carter, © 2025)
 * 		for use in the TP1 Foundations-SU26 application; added the maximum-length requirement.
